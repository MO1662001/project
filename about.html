        <h2>Benefits of Sport</h2>
        <p>
          Sport strengthens the heart, and makes it increase the pumping of
          blood to the body, and this benefit returns to the health of the body
          positively, and makes it resistant to many diseases, especially the
          following diseases: Cardiac arrest. Stroke. Arteriosclerosis.

        <h2>Body Mass Index</h2>
        <p>
          Exercise can help prevent excessive weight gain or help stabilize
          weight after you lose weight. When you do physical activity, your body
          burns calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you
          burn.

        <h2>Healthy for the Body</h2>
        <p>A healthy diet helps prevent malnutrition in all its forms, as well as noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.
            Unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are among the most prominent global risks to health.
            Healthy eating practices begin early – breastfeeding promotes healthy growth and improves cognitive development, and may have longer-term health benefits such as reducing the risk of being overweight or obese and developing noncommunicable diseases later on.</p>
