      <h1 class="zz">No matter how slow your path is, you're still better than lying on the sofa.

        – What seems difficult to you now, will soon be part of the warm-up.
        
        – Summer bodies are made in winter.
        
        – Pain is temporary, but stopping is a constant pain.
        
        When you feel like you want to stop and give up, remember how many people you have to prove to have made such a decision.
        
        Building your muscles is not to be better than anyone else, it is to be better than you are.
        
        – Do today what others will not do, to do tomorrow what others cannot do.
        
        – He will attack you once, twice, ten times the feeling of surrender, attack him and strongly</h1>
